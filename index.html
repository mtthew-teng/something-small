                <p>Dear Micky,</p>

                <p>
                    There's not much I can say here that I haven't already told you. I'm not great at writing things like this, and honestly, I usually just try to say how I feel about you when I feel it. But I wanted to try putting it all down in one place.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When we first got together, I didn't know where things would go. I wasn't sure how this would work out, or what it would look like months down the line. But the more time we spend together,  the more certain I am that I want you in my future. (Even with that temper of yours ðŸ˜…)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lately, with some time off before the new job, I've had a lot more time to just sit with my thoughts. And a lot of them have been about you. Sometimes I just wonder what you're doing in that moment, or try to picture it in my head. Other times, I'm just thinking about what it'll be like when we're finally in the same place.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I didn't expect how much I'd end up missing you. It caught me off guard, how often you're on my mind, and how strange it feels to care this much about someone who isn't right here. I've never really been someone who gets attached easily, but now the space between us is the one thing I wish I could just erase.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Even with that, I'm happy. I'm happy we're together, and I'm excited that us seeing each other in person is starting to feel more and more real. You make my days better, and I look forward to every conversation with you. I've never felt this hopeful about the future before, and that's because of you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You mean a lot meâ€”more than you probably realize. And I just wanted you to know that.
                </p>

                <p>Love always,</p>
                <p>Matthew ðŸ’–</p>
